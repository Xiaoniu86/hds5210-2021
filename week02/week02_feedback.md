Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  5/5

5.3 Just to note, you changed the function name to `height_m` which caused the `assert` statements in the cell below to fail.  It's helpful for me if your notebook will run all the way through without errors, so please make sure that "Kernel -> Restart and Run All Cells" works when you submit the work.


Otherwise, great work!
