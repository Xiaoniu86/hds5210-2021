Part 1:  5/5

Part 2:  4/5

20.3 - Didn't quite get there, but you were close.  Instead of just assing the one name to `families[name[0]]=first_name`, you need to build a list in `families[name[0]]`  -1

20.4 - This works, but you don't have to loop over the `avg_los`.  Instead, you can instantly find the one where `patient[1] == diag` by asking for it, as in `avg_log[patient[1]]`.  What you wrote works, though.
