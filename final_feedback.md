Congratulations on completing your Python final project.  I hope that you got some valuable experience and knowledge from our work together this semester.  Please feel free to reach out to me any time in the future.  You can connect with me on LinkedIn and message me there any time.  I look forward to seeing what the future has in store for you.

Here's feedback on your final project, but if you'd like more detail, please reach out to me.

Nice work on your final, overall.

One note, in the notebook format, you can change some cells to markdown for easier documentation.  That makes it easier to read than using a cell filled with Python comments.

It would have been very helpful to have more explanation of what you were doing with your code throughout the project.  As it was, I found things hard to follow (and I know a few things about genetics).

On charts, always remember to label both axes.  :) 

Nice topic and I appreciated all the work.
